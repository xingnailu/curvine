## 🗂️ Cached File System Access
### 🦀 Rust API (Recommended for Native Integration)
```
use curvine_common::conf::ClusterConf;
use curvine_common::fs::Path;
use std::sync::Arc;

let conf = ClusterConf::from(conf_path);
let rt = Arc::new(conf.client_rpc_conf().create_runtime());
let fs = CurvineFileSystem::with_rt(conf, rt)?;

let path = Path::from_str("/dir")?;
fs.mkdir(&path).await?;
```

### 📌 FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)
```
ls /curvine-fuse
```

### 🐘 Hadoop Compatible API
```
import org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration;
import org.apache.hadoop.fs.*;

Configuration conf = new Configuration();
conf.set("fs.cv.impl", "io.curvine.CurvineFileSystem");

FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get(URI.create("cv://master:8995"), conf);
FSDataInputStream in = fs.open(new Path("/user/test/file.txt"));
```

## 🛠 Build Instructions

This project requires the following dependencies. Please ensure they are installed before proceeding:

### 📋 Prerequisites

- ​**GCC**: version 10 or later ([Installation Guide](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/))
- ​**Rust**: version 1.86 or later ([Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
- ​**Protobuf**: version 3.x
- ​**Maven**: version 3.8 or later ([Install Guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html))
- ​**LLVM**: version 12 or later ([Installation Guide](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html))
- ​**FUSE**: libfuse2 or libfuse3 development packages
- ​**JDK**: version 1.8 or later (OpenJDK or Oracle JDK)
- ​**npm**: version 9 or later ([Node.js Installation](https://nodejs.org/))
- ​**Python**: version 3.7 or later ([Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

You can either:
1. Use the pre-configured `curvine-docker/compile/Dockerfile_rocky9` to build a compilation image
2. Reference this Dockerfile to create a compilation image for other operating system versions
3. We also supply `curvine/curvine-compile` image on dockerhub

### 🚀 Build Steps (Linux - Ubuntu/Debian example)
Using make to build:

```bash
# Build all modules
make all

# Build core modules only: server client cli
make build ARGS="-p core"

# Build fuse and core modules
make build ARGS="-p core -p fuse"
```


Using build.sh directly:

```bash
# Build all modules
sh build/build.sh 

# Display command help 
sh build/build.sh -h

# Build core modules only: server client cli
sh build/build.sh -p core

# Build fuse and core modules
sh build/build.sh -p core -p fuse
```

Building Docker images:

```bash
# or use curvine-compile:latest docker images to build
make docker-build

# or use curvine-compile:build-cached docker images to build, this image already cached most dependency crates
make docker-build-cached
```

After successful compilation, target file will be generated in the build/dist directory. This file is the Curvine installation package that can be used for deployment or building images.

### 🖥️  Start a single - node cluster
```bash
cd build/dist

# Start the master node
bin/curvine-master.sh start

# Start the worker node
bin/curvine-worker.sh start
```

Mount the file system
```bash
# The default mount point is /curvine-fuse
bin/curvine-fuse.sh start
```

View the cluster overview:
```bash
bin/cv report
```

Access the file system using compatible HDFS commands:
```bash
bin/cv fs mkdir /a
bin/cv fs ls /
```

Access Web UI：
```
http://your-hostname:9000
```

Curvine uses TOML - formatted configuration files. An example configuration is located at conf/curvine-cluster.toml. The main configuration items include:

- Network settings (ports, addresses, etc.)
- Storage policies (cache size, storage type)
- Cluster configuration (number of nodes, replication factor)
- Performance tuning parameters

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

Curvine adopts a master-slave architecture:

- **Master Node**: Responsible for metadata management, worker node coordination, and load balancing.
- **Worker Node**: Responsible for data storage and processing.
- **Client**: Communicates with the Master and Worker nodes via RPC.

The system uses the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure metadata consistency and supports multiple storage strategies (memory, SSD, HDD) to optimize performance and cost.

## 📈 Performance

Curvine performs excellently in high-concurrency scenarios and supports:

- High-throughput data read and write
- Low-latency operations
- Large-scale concurrent connections
